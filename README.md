# Hangman

This is a full-fledged functioning Hangman game that anyone can play. Unlike other Hangman games  on the internet where word possibilities are astoundingly low, this particular game boasts a list of whopping 370093 possible words. Everytime the game is run, a new word is randomly chosen from the list and the user is asked to guess it letter by letter. Furthermore, the user has control of the game as he/she can set the maximum number of tries. 

## How to play?

The easiest way to play this game is to download the "HangMan.jar" file and then type `java -jar path-to-HangMan.jar` in command prompt/terminal followed by enter. The game will start right away.

Another way to run this game is to download the source files and compile them and subsequently use the same command as earlier. 

To play the game again after it has ended, just type `java -jar path-to-HangMan.jar` again and hit enter.
